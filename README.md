# Fabrication Techniques and Materials
The following machines will be needed for fabrication
1. FDM Printer
2. Resin Printer
3. Desktop CNC Router
4. Soldering Iron
5. Drill
6. Dremel

Additionally, a full list of materials with links to purchasing sites can be found here(insert link to excel)
# Build/Assembly
There are three main components to this build. The first is machining, printing and cutting parts. The second is soldering the circuit schematic together and the third is epoxying and bolting together the full assembly. 

Step 1: Machining, Printing and Cutting

The parts to print are seperated into resin and FDM parts and can be found here(insert link to stls). The resin parts require higher fidelity; for example, the servo couplers which need to mate to a spline which has teeth size on the order of a single millimeter. The FDM parts are generally larger and require less fidelity. A lightweight material called (insert name of robbie material) was used with low infill to reduce the wieght of these larger parts. 

The parts that require CNC work include the legs as well as the battery holder. In order to meet the stiffness requirements that would be neccesary from supporting the thrust mechanism as well as shock from landing, 3mm Carbon fiber was chosen as the material for the legs. A desktop CNC router was used to cut the parts to ensure accuracy. The settings used were (insert settings) and the CAD/CAM files can be found here (insert CAD/CAM files link).

A number of parts also required cutting to get parts down to the right size. The shafts holding the motors were cut using a dremel and the rocket tube was cut using an X acto knife. A part was also printed to help guide this X acto knife cut and can be found here (insert link to jabe part).
